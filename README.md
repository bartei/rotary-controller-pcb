# Rotary Controller PCB

This repository contains the Proteus files for the rotary controller schematic and PCB.

## Firmware and Python Application

Under my account, you can also find the firmware code and the associated Python application. The Python application is specifically designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi and serves as a Digital Readout (DRO) and single-axis controller using the PCB board.

## Manufacturing Files

In addition to the Proteus files, this repository includes a zip file that contains all the necessary files required for manufacturing the PCB. This ensures that you have everything you need to get started with production.

## Pricing Information

To assist with cost estimation, the Proteus bill of materials (BOM) in this project includes pricing information for the components used. Please note that the provided part numbers and pricing are subject to change based on market availability.

## KiCad Version

I am currently working on developing a KiCad version of this project. This will enable users to contribute or review the design without the need to purchase a Proteus license. Stay tuned for updates on the KiCad version!

## Viewing the Project

If you don't have a Proteus license, you can always download a trial version of the software to open and view this project. This allows you to explore the schematic and PCB layout.

## Future Plans

Proteus is my preferred tool for this project, but I understand that switching to a different tool may be more accessible for some users. While it is currently time-consuming to make the switch, I plan to migrate to a different tool when I have the opportunity.
